Geometric and topological trace network analysis
================================================

Description
-----------

This Python module can be used to extract lineament & fracture size,
abundance and topological parameters from two-dimensional lineament and
fracture trace, branch and node data. The results will be given as
graphical plots.

Prerequisites
-------------

See: `Prerequisites <validation/basics.html#Prerequisites>`__

It is recommended to validate the trace data first before using it as an
input for extracting branches and nodes. Otherwise the extraction
process might error out or result in invalid branches and nodes.

Branches and nodes
------------------

Topologically a trace network of lineaments or fractures can be
dissolved into branches and nodes. Branches represent individual
segments of traces and each segment has a node on each end. Nodes
represent either interactions with other traces or isolated abutments.
See `Sanderson and Nixon,
2015 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191814115000152?via%3Dihub>`__
for a more detailed explanation.
