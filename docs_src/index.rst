Trace data must be validated using ``fractopo`` validation functionality before
analysis. The topological analysis of lineament & fracture traces implemented
in ``fractopo`` will not tolerate uncertainty related to the topological
abutting and snapping relationships between traces. Therefore the
trace validation is recommended before all analysis using ``Network``.

See above links for:

-  Basic trace data validation workflows
-  Examples of validation error types

For trace validation also see above guide on ``tracevalidate`` command-line
tool.  After trace data validation, ``Network`` analysis can be conducted.
