   Visualization of ``fractopo`` data. ``fractopo`` analyses the trace data
   that can e.g. be digitized from drone orthophotographs (fractures) or from
   digital elevation models (lineaments). The displayed branches and nodes are
   extracted with ``fractopo``.

Trace data must be validated using ``fractopo`` validation functionality before
analysis. The topological analysis of lineament & fracture traces implemented
in ``fractopo`` will not tolerate uncertainty related to the topological
abutting and snapping relationships between traces. Therefore the
trace validation is recommended before all analysis using ``Network``.

See above links for:

-  Basic trace data validation workflows
-  Examples of validation error types

For trace validation also see `above guide <#trace-validation>`__ on
``tracevalidate`` command-line tool.  After trace data validation, ``Network``
analysis can be conducted.
